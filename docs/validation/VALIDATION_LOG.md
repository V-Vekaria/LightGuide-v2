# LightGuide — Validation Log

## Purpose
This is the evidence record for LightGuide. Product and engineering documents may contain hypotheses; this file records what was actually tested, observed and concluded.

## Evidence rule
Every important architecture decision should eventually point to one or more entries here, a linked experiment report, or another reproducible source of evidence.

## Entry template

### VAL-XXX — Short title
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Question:** What uncertainty are we testing?  
**Requirement/risk:** Link to requirement or risk ID where applicable.  
**Method:** Exact test procedure.  
**Equipment:** Phone/hardware/software and versions.  
**Environment:** Distance, lighting, room/studio conditions, marker size, etc.  
**Trials:** Number of repeated trials.  
**Ground truth:** How truth was independently measured.  
**Results:** Raw/summary measurements.  
**Pass criteria:** Predefined threshold.  
**Outcome:** PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE.  
**Decision:** What changes because of this result?  
**Artifacts:** Links to CSV, screenshots, video, code or experiment folder.

## Planned validation

### VAL-001 — AR pose repeatability
**Status:** Planned  
**Question:** Can Android ARCore + a known visual reference repeatedly estimate the light stand pose accurately enough for V1?  
**Risk:** R-001  
**Experiment:** `../../experiments/phase-0-ar-positioning/`  
**Primary measures:** position error, orientation error, relocalisation success, scan time and tracking failures.  
**Initial target:** approximately 3–5 cm position and 2–3° orientation under supported conditions.

### VAL-002 — Marker size and detection range
**Status:** Planned  
**Question:** What marker/reference dimensions provide practical detection without making the product awkward in a studio?  
**Risk:** R-002  
**Measures:** detection distance, viewing angle, reacquisition time and user handling.

### VAL-003 — Cross-session relocalisation
**Status:** Planned  
**Question:** Can the saved reference frame be re-established reliably in a later session?  
**Risk:** R-003  
**Measures:** restoration error after ending/restarting the AR session and moving the phone.

### VAL-004 — End-to-end one-light recreation
**Status:** Future  
**Question:** Does the integrated system let a user restore a moved light faster and/or more consistently than a manual method?  
**Measures:** completion time, final geometry error, failed attempts, user comprehension and photographic outcome.

## Decision discipline
Do not convert a target into a claimed specification until it has passed a defined validation test under stated conditions.

## Source recovery audit — 2026-09-10

The implementation was found on branch experiment/phase-0-ar-positioning at 5bc532b0d1bfd94f8f554867eec94e7403d1a7ce and incorporated into the current baseline. See [source audit](AR_SOURCE_AUDIT_2026-09-10.md) for methods, evidence and code gaps.

Outcome: source/assets located and inspected; no new physical trial or Android build/test pass claimed. VAL-001–004 remain open. Historical marker observations in the recovered printing instructions are retained, not promoted into a complete ±3 cm result.

## 11 September 2026 — independent Codex build

See [CODEX_BUILD_2026-09-11.md](CODEX_BUILD_2026-09-11.md) for executed checks and pending native/physical validation. App IDs and branch are isolated for comparison with Claude.
